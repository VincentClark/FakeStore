Updated: 8/2/2021

### Version 1.0

- Migrated from GitLab. Unable to bring history.

## Verision 1.09

- Created a JSON to drive the files through a video route 'fakestore-rearend/server/media-library/videos/video_data/video_playlist.json' (this is a temp solution before putting into DB)
- Access the video_playlist.json through localhost:8080/videos/videolist
- This is currently set on the route portion, plan to move into the video service when migrating to a DB solution.
- video-player Comonents/Pages/FS5VideoPlayer imports JSON from video server.
- Adjusted to update on src change ~/Components/Parts/HTML5Video.js

### Testing Video Service

1. start rearend server
1. In your web browser navigate to (http://localhost:3000/videos/videofiles?videosrc=testvideo1)
1. To change video to second test replace the value in videosrc to ScrubJay_20210511.mp4

1. ENSUER THAT YOU ADD ANY TEST VIDEOS TO .gitignore

## Adding Videos

Due to limitation test videos could not be a part of the build. For security reasons, you must place your own videos to test.
_Version 1.0x_
Place the videos in fakestore-rearend/server/media*library/videos_available/
Use the url: localhost:8080/videos/videofiles?videosrc=\_your video*
This will change in Version 1.1

# Updates

## Version 1.0

Transfered this project from GitLab. The video files had to be removed from the project. See _how to add Videos_ to ensure a proper test.
